// For CPU-intensive operations
let result: Vec<_> = data
    .par_iter()
    .map(|item| expensive_calculation(item))
    .collect();

// For sorting
data.par_sort_by(|a, b| a.cmp(b));
```

### Traditional Processing Setup
```rust
// For simple operations
let result: Vec<_> = data
    .iter()
    .map(|item| simple_operation(item))
    .collect();
```

### Async Processing Setup
```rust
use tokio::runtime::Runtime;

let rt = Runtime::new().unwrap();
let result = rt.block_on(async {
    async_collections::map_keypath_async(data, keypath, operation).await
});
```

## Conclusion

The performance analysis reveals that **parallel processing is the clear winner for CPU-intensive operations on large datasets**, providing 2-6x speedup consistently. However, **traditional processing remains optimal for simple operations on smaller datasets** due to lower overhead.

### Apple M1 Specific Considerations

The results are particularly relevant for Apple M1 systems due to:

1. **Heterogeneous Core Architecture**: The M1's 4 performance + 4 efficiency cores provide excellent parallel processing capabilities
2. **Unified Memory System**: Shared memory reduces data movement overhead in parallel operations
3. **High Memory Bandwidth**: ~68 GB/s bandwidth supports high-throughput parallel operations
4. **Power Efficiency**: The M1's efficiency cores help maintain performance while minimizing power consumption

These characteristics make the Apple M1 particularly well-suited for parallel processing workloads, which explains the significant speedups observed in CPU-intensive operations.

**Key Takeaway**: Choose the right tool for the job:
- **Parallel** for CPU-intensive work on large datasets
- **Traditional** for simple operations or small datasets  
- **Async** for I/O-bound operations and concurrent processing

The KeyPath library provides excellent support for all three approaches, allowing developers to choose the optimal strategy based on their specific use case and performance requirements.
